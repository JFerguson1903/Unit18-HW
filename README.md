## Description

I was given the assignment through Triliogy/WASHU Coding Bootcamp to "add functionality to our existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online". 

The user story was that, "AS AN avid traveller I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling".
